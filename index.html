    <!-- STORY STARTS HERE -->
    <p>Lacking the ability to access digital technology often means being isolated in a technologically driven society, such as the one present in New York City. Over 30% of older adults in New York City do not have a computer or tablet in their home, according to the NYC Department of the Aging’s “The State of Older New Yorkers” report released in July. Of those adults who lack access to a computer at home, 31.3% reported they could not afford to buy a computer or tablet, while another 25.4% stated they required instruction on how to use those devices.</p>

    <p>To help mitigate these issues of accessibility and digital education amongst the city’s elderly adult community, New York City offers 470 public computer centers throughout the five boroughs. Being able to access the internet can help reduce the isolation already felt by older adults by allowing them to stay connected to the world around them.</p>

    <p>The NYC Office of Technology and Innovation (OTI) oversees 470 public computer centers, totalling more than 5,598 workstations. The infrastructure includes the “Digital Vans” operated by the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), each equipped with eight computer workstations and internet access. Public libraries run 42% of those centers, while the NYC Department of Aging operates another 37%. A third of the city’s centers (155 centers) are exclusively reserved for elderly New Yorkers.</p>

    <p>Beyond providing access to the devices, the city offers technology courses across a wide range of skill levels — from UI and UX design, to setting up LinkedIn profiles, to one-on-one beginner classes. Approximately 80% of computer centers in NYC offer these tech-related courses. 171 centers offer courses specifically on digital literacy.</p>
    <!-- WRAPUP THE STORY HERE -->
    
    <p>Digital equity remains a key focus among city leaders. In March, the Adams administration released a roadmap outlining the city’s plans to bridge the digital divide. As part of the roadmap, the Mayor's office invested $2.4 million in these programs, dedicating a portion of the funding to addressing resource gaps at public computer centers.</p>

    <p>"Our focus remains on the fundamentals of digital equity: equitable access to the internet, to devices, and to digital skills training," said NYC Chief Technology Officer Matthew Fraser during the release of the roadmap.</p>
